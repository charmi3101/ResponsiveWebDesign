                                16 April 2020
                            </p>
                            <p>The CN Tower is a tall and impressive tower and a landmark in Toronto, Canada and visiting this popular attraction is definitely one of those “must-do” items on your list when you travel to Toronto.Although I tend to prefer exploring offbeat places and neighbourhoods when I travel, I still do enjoy finding a balance between getting off the beaten path while still checking out at least one main attraction at my destination. I have always wanted to see the views from the top of the CN Tower, so when I traveled to Toronto last month I made sure to add the tower to my itinerary. I visited the CN Tower during my solo travels to Toronto in January 2020 on a lovely Sunday morning.</p>
                            <p>I arrived at the tower at around 9:30 am on a Sunday morning.I walked to the base of the tower and looked way up. It was an incredibly tall structure and this view provided some great photo opportunities. I only wished that I had a wider lens for my camera, as I was almost falling backwards trying to get the entire tower in my photo! The fact that humans built such a tall tower was definitely impressive.

                                <h1>Through Mountains to the Sea</h1>
                                <p>A journey on the A66 through the Lake District to West Cumbria.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <p>Before the Lake District of North West England was made famous by the Romantic poets who lived there, it was an inhospitable place. In the 1720s, a more worldly writer, Daniel Defoe, travelled around Great Britain in search of commerce and industry, hoping to find evidence that the newly united country was being remade by the kinds of improvements to “the lands, the trade, and manufactures” he had seen all around his London home. When he arrived at the old road that passed through the Lakes to the Cumbrian coast, he faced a forbidding prospect of unrelenting peaks and steep valleys, “the wildest, most barren, and frightful” lands he had ever seen. “I could not but be apprehensive for my neck,” he wrote. The “unpassable hills, whole tops, covered with snow,” signaled that “the pleasant part of England was at an end.”</p>

                        <div class="image"></div>

                        <p>Apparently discouraged by the direct approach through the central Lakes, Defoe attempted to confine his movements to the low terrain that wrapped around the mountains, following in part an old Roman road on his journey to the west coast. There he visited Whitehaven, the “most eminent” coal trading port in England after Newcastle, where it was not unusual to see “200 sail of ships at a time” making out for Dublin; and Workington, at the mouth of the river Derwent, which would grow through similar trade to become a major site of steel production in the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>



                        <p>The virtue of this landscape, for Coleridge, was the possibility of mind-expanding experiences where he could locate the sublime, in all its “agreeable horror.” 28 Of course, he did not spend all his time at home, sitting on the roof. He liked nothing better than to get lost in the mountains, to face the “obscurity and darkness” that hung over the chasms, and be tested by nature’s obstacles and terrors. To this end, he invented a Romantic version of Russian roulette. As Macfarlane describes it:<b>
                                Coleridge’s gambling worked as follows. Pick a mountain, any mountain. Climb to the top of it and then, instead of “winding about ’till you find a track or other symptom of safety” — instead of looking for the easy way down — wander on, and “where it is first possible to descend,” descend, and “rely upon fortune for how far down this possibility will continue.”</b></p>
